# [Internship-GRAFIMAGE] Commercial Management Platform
During an internship of 5 months, me, Ayoub Daoudi and Karim Bourass have developed a commercial platform that helps a wholesaler to manage easily its inventory, sales, purchases, expenses, quotations, customers and suppliers.

#### We've first met the wholesaler and identified the client needs and built the software specifications.

      - Backend : JAVA EE, Spring Framework, Hibernate, Rest API.
